3.) Add traction to car physics
4.) turn movement if statements into a switch
5.) Car movement seems a bit blurred
6.) Sounds
    3 sounds for car engine
    sand sound
    dirt sound
    hitting a rock or edge of the screen sound
    menu button sounds
    music
7.) add speedometer
10.) better way to create new images
11.) turn faster when moving faster
13.) all images need to be in an onload function
15.) Why is updateGame called in both player.js and game_loop.js
16.) Move trees and tents to correct spot for collision map
17.) Would it be higher performance to use RBG values instead of converting to hex code?

Completed
1.) Remove event listen from function and try separately
2.) Add acceleration to car physics
8.) rounding problem with player speed
9.) clean up files
    main game js file
    initialize assets js file
12.) make variable for canvas width/height
14.) Should probably pull spritesheet tiles out of requestAnimFrame.  Is this being drawn each frame?

grass > track > player > objects
what is track_01 in index.js?

Ideas for physics and traction:
Keep a running array of the last few angles and where the car was facing
if you try to corner too fast it will use a point in between where you would be with the previous angle and current one making it harder to turn

For hit detection:
If car pixel is >= to the pixel of an object and <= to the pixel of an object + 1 then there is a collision
Since speed and positions are to the hundreds of a pixel it can be in between
